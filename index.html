  <h1>Tracking Activity with a Fitbit: A Data Story</h1>
  <p>   Wearable technology is the biggest growing market in the technological world. These products are increasing in sales each day. However, how closely are they being examined by users. Do you know what information your technology collects? What about how that information is used by the company? I asked myself these questions about my Fitbit, collected the data, and did some background research on the company to find the answer. </p>

    <div><p>As a sophomore in college, I've gotten used to walking around campus, the kind of foods that are offered in dining halls, and how much exercise I complete on a daily basis. The summer before sophomore year, I decided to perchase a Fitbit to see how far I walked while working as a server (an average of 7 miles a shift!). When the school year started, I decided to use my new Fitbit as the focus for this project. </p></div>

  <!-- PERSONAL-DATA -->
  <h2>The Data I Collected</h2>
  <section id="personal-data">
  <p>My Fitbit was set up to notify me ten minutes before the hour if I did not move at least 250 steps. The two main catagories of my data are centered around either a notification, or when I manually checked my step count during the day. Here are some examples of the types of data I collected over a five day period:</p>
  <ul><li>Time of day</li></ul>
  <ul><li>Location</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Emotional Response</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Step Count</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Reaction (Did I get up and move after a notification?) </li></ul>
  </section>

  <!-- DATA VIZ -->
    <h2>My Data: Visually</h2>
    <p>To find my activity pattern from all the data I collected, I represented it visually. In the data visualization below, you will find my locations and emotions associated with either a notification or a step self-check. The more petals on a flower, the more instances occured, the lease active I was. </p>

  <p>All this data was interesting to look at in regards to my personal activity level. However, the questions arose as to not how I percieve this information, but how Fitbit as a company does. All this information is collected on my Fitbit and wirelessly stored on my moblie device in my account with Fitbit. To answer what Fitbit, Inc. does with this information, I looked into their terms of use and privacy policy.</p>

<!--  Fitbit Legal -->
<h2>Fitbit Terms of Use and Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>When creating a Fitbit account, I provided information like my height, weight, age, name, email, phone number, everything about myself. After collecting all my data and seeing what kinds of conclusions I could draw from the numbers alone, I wanted to see what Fitbit does with all of my account information. Three are three main parts to the information I found: sharing of non-personal information, exceptions to the policy, and selling data to third parties. </p>
<section id="legal">
  <div><h4>Non-Personal Information</h4><p>According to Fitbit's privacy policy, they may use and release "information that is aggregated or de-indentified so that it cannot reasonably be used to identify an individual" for any reason and without notifying the user.</p></div>
  <div><h4>Example: Business Wire's List of the Fittest Countries and U.S. Cites</h4><p>Business Wire collected this aggregated information from Fitbit users all over the world to compile a list of the fittest countries, and the fittest cities in the U.S.. No personal information was shared, just the activity level and the location of a user. Since this information was grouped together so there was no way to identify one user for an entire city or country, it did not go against Fitbit's user policy. </p></div>
  </section>
  <section id="legal2">
    <div><h4>The Exception: Police Investigations</h4><p>Generally speaking, Fitbit adheres to their privacy policy and does not give away personal information. However, they do clearly state that they "may preserve or disclose information about to comply with a law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request."</p></div>
    <div><h4>Example: The Murder of Connie Debate</h4><p>Connie Debate was murdered and the key piece of evidence for investigators was the Fitbit she was wearing when she died. Her husband's story that he gave the police had a few holes in it - so they tested the time stamp and step counts of her Fitbit. Police used this information to disprove her husband's timeline of events and eventually charge him with murdering his wife. Fitbit did not their privacy policy with Connie by giving her personal Fitbit information to the police, because of this exceptions section of their policy.</p></div>
  </section>
  <section id="legal3">
    <div><h4>Selling Information to Third Parties</h4><p>The last portion of Fitbit's privacy policy that concerns sharing account information is their policy on selling to third parties. The policy states that they openly "transfer information to our corporate affiliates, service providers, and other partners who process it for us." When a Fitbit user agrees to this privacy policy, they are agreeing to their information being sold to these third parties for processing.</p></div>
    <div><h4>Example: Fitbits and Cancer Research</h4><p>Selling information to third parites often seems unethical and 'dirty', but it can acutally be extremely benefitial. Gadgets and Wearables wrote and article explaining how some doctors are actually having their cancer patients wear Fitbits during treatment to watch how their activity levels and the effectiveness of their treatments are related. Collecting data from Fitbits for research in the medical field is becoming a common practice and has proven to be benefitial for doctor's research because they can use tangible numbers and evidence of activity instead of the patient's word.</p></div>

<p>Here's a short video combining all this legal talk for your convenience.</p>

<!-- Conclusion -->
  <section id="conclusion">
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>After collecting my own set of data and researching how Fitbit uses this data, I have concluded that Fitbits are used for more than their intended purpose when evaluated in a research setting. Additionally, the research that Fitbit data is used for does not violate the terms of Fitbit's privacy policy.</p>
